# Ultimate-Backdoor
## Instructions
1. Make sure you **installed and ran** the file on the victim's computer
2. If it's running you can access it anywhere as long as you made a server and stuff for it.
3. I would **recommend** in a real *"ethical"* situation you would need to put it in **startup** and probably make it a **exe** using ***pyinstaller***

## Features
### Console
When you open the program with a **victim** or ***not*** you can type *"help"* to get *all* the commands

### File Explorer
This is like any generic file explorer that I *will** be expanding on to make it **better** but for now you can do the basics.

### Tasks (WIP)
There will be more tasks added but for now you can do some basic things like setting timeout time and uploading files

This is where you can switch tabs with ease, change your appearance mode to either "Dark" *Default*, "Light" *Your crazy*, or "System" *Defaults to your system's appearance*, and Exit which is self-explanatory and does the same thing the **X** does.
