# Ultimate-Backdoor
## Instructions
1. Make sure you **installed and ran** the file on the victim's computer
2. If it's running you can access it anywhere if you made a server and stuff for it.
3. I would **recommend** in a real *"ethical"* situation you would need to put it in **startup** and probably make it a **exe** using ***pyinstaller***

## Features
### Console
When you open the program with a **victim** or ***not*** you can type *"help"* to get *all* the commands <br />
**ADDED MORE COMMANDS** <br />

If you select a file it will show at the top right saying the path to it. <br />
Once you select a file and either go to a desired location or not, you can press one of the buttons to do that task. <br />
New Features:
- Cutting / Moving
- Copying
- Downloading *(Existed but was bad)*
- Removing *(Also existed but wasn't in the file explorer yet)*
### Tasks
- Timeout Time *(Amount of time to wait until it times out)*

- File Upload *(Upload file of choice)*
- *If you have any cool ideas that would be **helpful** let me know in the **issues tab***

This is where you can switch tabs with ease, change your appearance mode to either "Dark" *Default*, "Light" *Your crazy*, or "System" *Defaults to your system's appearance*, and Exit which is self-explanatory and does the same thing the **X** does.

### Known Bugs / Issues
- The command code needs to be reworked but works well; it is just confusing in the code.
- If you encounter ***ANY*** issues please let me know I wanna make this the best I can.
