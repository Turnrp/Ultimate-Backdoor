# Ultimate-Backdoor
## Instructions
1. Make sure you **installed and ran** the file on the victim's computer
2. If it's running you can access it anywhere as long as you made a server and stuff for it.
3. I would **recommend** in a real *"ethical"* situation you would need to put it in **startup** and probably make it a **exe** using ***pyinstaller***

## Features
### Console
When you open the program with a **victim** or ***not*** you can type *"help"* to get *all* the commands <br />

If you select a file it will show at the top right saying the path to it.
Once you select a file and either go to a desired location or not, you can press one of the buttons to do that task.
New Features:
- Cutting / Moving
- Copying
- Downloading (Existed But Was Bad)
- Removing (Also Existed But Was Not In The Explorer)
### Tasks (WIP)
There will be more tasks added but for now you can do some basic things like setting timeout time and uploading files <br />

This is where you can switch tabs with ease, change your appearance mode to either "Dark" *Default*, "Light" *Your crazy*, or "System" *Defaults to your system's appearance*, and Exit which is self-explanatory and does the same thing the **X** does. <br />
